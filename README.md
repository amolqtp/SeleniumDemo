This is a sample Selenium/Java/Maven project to understand web automation testing using Selenium [open source] libraries. <br>
Selenium is just another tool like QTP/UFT, TestComplete, Renorax, Watir, Sikuli. <br>

Selenium does not support automation for FAT applications [windows based], Mainframs, WPF, SAP & many more. <br>
